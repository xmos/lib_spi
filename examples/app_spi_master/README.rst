How to use the SPI library as SPI master
========================================

Summary
-------

This application note shows how to use the SPI library to make the
xCORE drive a SPI bus as SPI master. The application is the simplest
example of setting up the library and performing a couple of
transactions.

The note covers both the synchronous and asynchronous use of the SPI
master components provided from the library.

Please refer to the main `lib_spi` documentation examples section
for setup, building and running of this example.
