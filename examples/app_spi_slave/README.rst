How to use the SPI library as SPI slave
=======================================

Summary
-------

This application note shows how to use the SPI library to make the
xCORE drive a SPI bus as SPI slave. The application implements
a SPI slave (driven by a test SPI master) as well as a
register set, similar to commercially available SPI devices,
which can be modified by the external master.

Please refer to the main `lib_spi` documentation examples section
for setup, building and running of this example.
